# Dynamic Diamonds

A simple Shiny app built to demonstrate dynamic SQL for a term paper. It
dynamically generates SQL filtering queries on the `diamonds` dataset from `ggplot`,
executes them, and summarizes the prices of diamonds in the subset.

To run, you'll need a SQLite installation, in addition to the required packages.
